# 2048 Game
Welcome to the 2048 Game! This project is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and reach the tile with the number 2048.

  - Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the respective direction.
  - Goal: Combine tiles with the same number to create a new tile with the sum. The ultimate objective is to reach the 2048 tile.

# How the Code Works
